## Summative Lab Overview

In this lab, you will create a Command-Line Interface (CLI) trivia game using JavaScript. This project reinforces your understanding of foundational JavaScript concepts such as handling user input, managing program flow, working with arrays and objects, and building interactive terminal-based applications.

## The Scenario

You are developing a CLI-based trivia game for an online quiz application. The trivia game should provide an engaging user experience by allowing players to answer questions, receive feedback on their performance, and manage their time effectively.

### User Interactions

The trivia quiz should allow for the following user interactions:
* Select answers to questions
* Get feedback on their answer
* Get feedback when the game is over
* Time the game
* Start a quiz game
* View quiz questions sequentially

## JavaScript Features

The trivia quiz be built using the following JavaScript functionality:
* Integrate loops and functions
* Develop a user friendly CLI
* Integrate asynchronous JavaScript feature: timers
* Use an array at least once
* Use an array iteration method at least once ("map","filter", "reduce", etc.)

## Instructions

### Task 1: Define the Problem

Your trivia game must meet the following functional requirements:

* Ensure users to start and answer questions.
* Provide users immediate feedback on their answers (e.g., correct or incorrect).
* Display a timer that limits the time for answering questions.
* Use core JavaScript features such as functions, arrays, objects, and timers to optimize functionality.

### Task 2: Determine the Design

**Trivia Functionality:**
* Implement functions that handle starting the game and presenting questions to the user
* Include logic for validating user answers and providing feedback.

**User Score:** Use data structures to store and display the results of the user's trivia session.

**Timed Feature:** Implement a feature that limits the duration of the game and enforces a time cap for answering questions.

### Task 3: Develop the Code 

Develop your code and script to match the design. Follow these guidelines as you write your code: 

**1. Efficiency:**
* Efficiency and readability of the code

**2. Functions and Variables:**
* Proper use of functions
* Appropriate variable names

**3. Accuracy:**
* Ensure the trivia logic works correctly, providing accurate results and scoring.

**4. Coding Best Practices:**
* Adhere to JavaScript coding conventions, such as consistent indentation, meaningful comments, and appropriate error handling.

**5. Clarity:**
* Clearly define the input and output of each function.
* Provide meaningful feedback to users through the CLI.

### Task 4: Test and Refine

Verify that the appropriate code blocks are executed based on the conditions. 
* Make any necessary adjustments to the code blocks to achieve the desired outcome.
* Run your program with different number of occurrences and parameters.
* Adhere to Javascript coding conventions and best practices.

### Task 5: Document and Maintain

**1. Version Control:** Use version control to track changes. This allows for easy updates, collaborative editing, and the ability to revert to previous versions if necessary.

**2. Regular Updates and Reviews:** Schedule regular reviews and updates for code to ensure content remains relevant, accurate, and aligned with the latest Javascript developments and industry practices.

**3. Documentation and Examples Repository:** Maintain a centralized repository containing all lab documents, example code, and solutions.
