# Lab: Building Timers in JavaScript

## Overview

In this lab, you will develop a JavaScript project that uses timers (`setTimeout` and `setInterval`) to create time-based functionalities. This lab will strengthen your understanding of JavaScript timers by implementing countdowns, reminders, and recurring tasks.

Pre-written test cases are provided, and your task is to implement the required functions to ensure the tests pass. This is an excellent opportunity to challenge your problem-solving and coding skills while working with essential JavaScript timer functionality.

## Scenario

You are a developer working on a productivity app. Your task is to implement the following features:

1. **Countdown Timer**: Logs the remaining time at regular intervals and stops at 0.
2. **Delayed Reminder**: Logs a reminder message after a specified delay.
3. **Recurring Timer**: Performs an action repeatedly at fixed intervals until stopped.

These features will help users manage their time effectively.
